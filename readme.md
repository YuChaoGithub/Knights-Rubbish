# Knights Rubbish
A "real life doodle"-styled platformer fighter (co-op arcade) game featuring our beloved character [Keshia Erasia](http://shinerightstudio.com/knights-rubbish-heroes/keshia-erasia) and [his friends](http://shinerightstudio.com/knights-rubbish-heroes/the-knights). They had risen from the rubbish and they seek for adventures. Exciting, eh?

(Made with Godot Engine.)
